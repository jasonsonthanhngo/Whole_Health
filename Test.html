      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TO THE PATIENT (AND OTHERS LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PATIENT):</strong> You have the right as a patient, to be informed about your condition and how Infusion therapy medicine may be applied in a treatment plan. This disclosure is intended to provide an opportunity for you to make an informed decision so that you may give or withhold your consent to treatment. I voluntarily request that Whole Health Infusion Clinic and other affiliated health care personnel as they may deem necessary, treat my condition (or the condition of the person for whom I am responsible). I understand that the treatment is planned for me (or the condition of the person for whom I am responsible), and I voluntarily consent and authorize to be treated. Please read the following information carefully and provide your consent by signing below.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I understand that no warranty or guarantee has been made regarding the results of treatment.</strong> I realize that there may be risks and hazards in treating this present health condition, with or without conventional medicine, and there may also be risks and hazards related to the planned treatment; including worsening of present symptoms, development of new symptoms, possible undesirable interactions between various treatments. Serious infusion reactions have been reported with Infliximab, including hives, difficulty breathing, and low blood pressure. Reactions have occurred during or after infusions. In clinical studies, some people experienced the following common side effects: respiratory infections (that may include sinus infections and sore throat), coughing, and stomach pain or mild reactions to infusion such as rash or itchy skin. The reports of serious infections, including tuberculosis (TB) and Reports of lymphoma (a type of cancer) in patients on Infliximab and other TNF blockers are rare but occur more often than in the general population. Some of these infections have been fatal. Nervous system disorders have also been reported.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I have been given an opportunity to ask questions about the treatment of this health condition using conventional methods with my ordering provider. I have had an opportunity to discuss the possible risks and hazards of treatment and non-treatment with my ordering provider, and I believe that I have sufficient information to give this informed consent.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I certify that I have read this form (or have asked to have it read to me), and that I understand its contents. I also certify that neither Whole Health Infusion Clinic nor any affiliated staff have made guarantees to me as to the success of this treatment.</p>
